# Matrix Variate Factor Model
Code for Statistical Inference for High Dimensional Matrix Variate Factor Model (Chen &amp; Fan, 2021, JASA) in R

data_generation.R for data generation in the simulation

est_RCFS.R for estimating matrix-variate factor model (R, C, F, S stand for row loading matrix, col loading matrix, common factors and signal part)

est_cov.R for estimating covariance matrix

main.R for general simulation process

You may check more information about code for this paper through https://github.com/ElynnCC/Matrix-Factor-Models/tree/main/MFM by the author Elynn Chen. The code is written in Python. There would be some more update on plotting and code acceleration (Rcpp will be used) soon.
